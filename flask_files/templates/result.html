            <h3>Explanation of Allocation Algorithm</h3>
            <p>The allocation algorithm aims to distribute items among agents based on their capacities and valuations while maximizing the total valuation.</p>
            <p>The allocation process is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each agent has a specified capacity, which indicates the number of items they can hold.</li>
                <li>Each item also has a specified capacity, indicating how many agents can hold that item.</li>
                <li>Valuations represent the preference or value each agent has for each item.</li>
                <li>The algorithm assigns items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation while respecting the capacities of both agents and items.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The total valuation is calculated by summing up the valuations of the assigned items for each agent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For each assignment, the value from the valuations dictionary corresponding to the agent and item pair is added.</li>
                <li>This sum represents the total valuation of the allocations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This result represents the best possible allocation for the given input, ensuring that it is both envy-free and Pareto optimal:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Envy-free: No agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.</li>
                <li>Pareto optimal: There is no other allocation that could make at least one agent better off without making another agent worse off.</li>
            </ul>
